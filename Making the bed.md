	_Making the Bed Perfectly_

	This is a step my step to make the bed.


1. Gather your bed linens.
2. Break out the iron.
3. Center and straighten the bed skirt. 
4. Pull the mattress pad smooth.
5. Tuck the fitted sheet tightly.  
6. Drape the flat sheet. 
7. Add the blanket.
8. Tuck in the flat sheet and the blanket together. 
9. Turn down the sheet and the blanket tops.
10. Add your desired topper.  
11. Layer the pillows.  
12. Top it off with a coverlet or throw.  
13. Bounce a quarter. Can't do it? Start over. Just kidding ... after all your work, you've earned the right to a little nap in your luxuriously outfitted nest. Sweet dreams!
